This was an enslaved man owned by C.C. Daugherty and T.W. Daugherty who also had another sibling, Boome Daugherty, and all three brothers were in the confederate army. The enslaved man who lived in the Afro-American quarters behind the home of three women, Mrs. T.W. Daugherty, Mrs. D.H. Fry and Mrs. Burris, is said to have been ill-mannered towards one of the women in the household. Citizens soon found out about this encounter and became horrified and outraged, so they sought the help of Lee’s Army, presumably a group of individuals that inflicted racial violence against enslaved peoples, union troops and supporters during the civil war. This group of individuals waited until nightfall to “quickly and quietly” extract this enslaved man from his quarters, however the other enslaved individuals had no idea what was going on. The man was found hanging in this tree by an older enslaved woman who lived in the Afro-American quarters with him. She recognized him saying,” That looks like Nelse!” Terrified, she returned to tell her mistress and the and the other enslaved individuals in the quarters what she saw that morning.</span><span class="v45_1714">Denton Record-Chronicle (Denton, Tex.), Vol. 26, No. 174, Ed. 1 Saturday, March 5, 1927</span><span class="v45_1716">Edwards, W.
