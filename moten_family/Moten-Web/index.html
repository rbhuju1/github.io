                Susie Whitlock Moten lived in Quakertown with her husband, Dr. Edwin Moten and her three children. Pictured with her her son, Edwin Donerson Moten Jr., 
                the only and youngest son of Susie and Dr. E. Moten born in 1920. Susie was born in 1881, and worked as a public school teacher before meeting and 
                marrying her husband and moving to Quakertown. The Motens lived in Quakertown from 1910-1922 at 79 Holt St. 
                This is a candid image of the mother and son at home in Quakertown. In the photograph Susie looks to the side while her son looks directly at the camera. 
                Both of them are sitting down on a lawn with a fence surrounding them.

                Dr. Motenâ€™s daughters Myrtle Bell Moten and Carrie Annetta Moten lived in Quakertown when they were young girls. Carrie Annetta Moten born in 1908 and 
                Myrtle Bell Moten was born less than a year later in 1909. The girls lived in Quakertown from 1910 - 1922. Much of their early childhood was spent in 
                Quakertown. In this formal picture taken of the children, they sit and stand on a chair, dressed up in white lacy clothes, with bows in both their hair.
