Pictured with her her son, Edwin Donerson Moten Jr., the only and youngest son of Susie and Dr. E. Moten born in 1920. 

Susie was born in 1881, and worked as a public school teacher before meeting and marrying her husband and moving to Quakertown. The Motens lived in Quakertown from 1910-1922 at 79 Holt St.

This is a candid image of the mother and son at home in Quakertown. In the photograph Susie looks to the side while her son looks directly at the camera. Both of them are sitting down on a lawn with a fence surrounding them.
