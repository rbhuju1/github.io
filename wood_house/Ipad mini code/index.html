William Evelyn Woods purchased the house in Quakertown for $600 during the first World War. He rented it out to residents while he remained on his farm located near Pilot Knob in Argyle.

In 1921, William Evelyn and his wife Alberta decided to move from the farm to the house in Denton. The City of Denton began forcing residents of Quakertown to relocate to make way for a public park. The Woods family sold their property in Quakertown and bought 8.8 acres on Solomon Hill. The Woods House will face one final move as it finds its new permanent home at the Denton County Historical Park.
