In the 1980’s, Quakertown, Denton was “rediscovered” by historians who wished to bring events to the light that had never been told properly. Interviews with descendants of the Quakertown residents have provided information that helped to shed more light on these happenings, and to keep the conversation going.

In 2013, the city placed a Historical Landmark marker on the site where Quakertown once stood, what is now Quakertown Park. It gives a brief overview of what took place, first detailing the thriving community that Quakertown once was, then describing the vote that was taken to replace it with the park, and the new area the residents moved to, where many of their descendants still live.
