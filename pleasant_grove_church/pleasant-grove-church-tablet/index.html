In March of 1923 Deacons Mays, Smith, Reynolds, and Ayers purchased the present-day site of the chuch and moved the old building onto it. In 1950, the old building was torn down and a new building was erected in its place. The only object that remained unchanged, however, was the old church bell, which now resides in the church’s attic as a symbol of durability and quality service.</span><div class="v58_30"></div><span class="v58_31">Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

While the exact date of when the building was built is unknown, it was located on Holt St, between Bell Ave and Oakland Ave in Quakertown. Deacon Marion Mays was most likely the founder of the organization known as Pleasant Grove missionary Baptist, and it is said that the Mays family, along with others of the Baptist faith, met near Pecan Creek in 1994 and organized this church.</span><div class="v58_34"></div><span class="v58_35">Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, circa 1880s</span></div></div><span class="v58_36">PLEASANT GROVE CHURCH</span><div class="v58_37"><div class="v58_38"></div><div class="v84_29"></div><div class="v84_30"></div></div></div></body></html>
