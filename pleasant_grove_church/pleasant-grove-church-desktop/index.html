                    <span class="v18_240">In December of 1922, the city of Denton purchased the land the church was located on, forcing the Pleasant Grove MBC to move. 
                        In March of 1923 Deacons Mays, Smith, Reynolds, and Ayers purchased the present-day site of the chuch and moved the old building onto it. In 1950, 
                        the old building was torn down and a new building was erected in its place. The only object that remained unchanged, however, was the old church 
                        bell, which now resides in the church’s attic as a symbol of durability and quality service.

                        Pleasant Grove missionary Baptist Church is the second oldest predominately-black churches in the city of Denton. 
                        While the exact date of when the building was built is unknown, it was located on Holt St, between Bell Ave and 
                        Oakland Ave in Quakertown. Deacon Marion Mays was most likely the founder of the organization known as Pleasant 
                        Grove missionary Baptist, and it is said that the Mays family, along with others of the Baptist faith, met near 
                        Pecan Creek in 1994 and organized this church.
