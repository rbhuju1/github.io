It was here that locals could buy and trade the goods they needed. When times were tough—and they were often tough, as in 1913 when the school burned down and a temporary classroom was needed—Crawford stepped forward. It served as a classroom until the schoolhouse could be rebuilt. It was a community space, where meetings about important matters could be held, and where civic organizations like the local chapter of the Black Odd Fellows could gather. Informally, Quakertown residents could pop in to do their shopping, play a friendly game of checkers with their neighbors, and catch up on the latest news and goings-on. Like Crawford himself, the store was a pillar of the community.

Among those meetings was the fateful one in December 1920, when the people of Quakertown learned that the fate of their community would be decided in an upcoming election by the white voters of Denton. In the aftermath, Crawford and his family left Denton forever, relocating to Wichita, Kansas, to start over.
