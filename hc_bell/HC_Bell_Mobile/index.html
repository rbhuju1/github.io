Bell (Right)</span><span class="v56_9">Marcellus C. Bell was born Marcellus Chambers in Galveston.  His father died in the Galveston Hurricane of 1900.  His mother was working as a nurse when she was approached by H. C. Bell, the principal of Fred Douglass School in Denton, while he was in Galveston on business for the Odd Fellows.  Professor Bell offered to take Marcellus to Denton in order for the small boy to receive a proper education.  Marcellus was raised by H. C. and Tennie C. Bell as their son.  He married Willie Jean Williams and they had nine children, two of whom died in infancy.  The Bells lived at the corner of Bell and Withers Streets in Quakertown and remained there for a few years after Quakertown was closed.</span><div class="v56_4"></div><span class="v67_102">H.C.
