<span class="v42_3457">In 1897, Angeline Burr and her four children arrived in Denton from Arkansas. 
    She was the first African-American woman to purchase land in Quakertown, she owned three homes that she rented out, some of which were even rented out by white tenants.
    She was known in Quakertown as “Aunt Angeline” and was well loved.
    She was a nurse and midwife who helped deliver both black and white babies.
    Miss Angeline is the only known departure mentioned in the Denton Record and Chronicle after the people of Quakertown were forced out of their homes.
    She and her family decided to move to California instead of moving to Solomon Hill like many of her neighbors.
