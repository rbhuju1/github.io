                        After Joeseph and Alice married and moved to Bell Avenue in Quaker Town, Alice operated a Kindergarten on their property. She cared for and 
                        looked after many of the children in Quaker Town during their residency.

                    <span class="v72_19">Texas Women’s University can be seen to the left of the couple. Originally married to Emily Weeks in 1878, and having several 
                        children with her, Joseph Skinner was a long-time resident of Denton. Mrs. Weeks passed in June 1913. On Christmas Day of that same year, 
                        Joeseph married Mrs. Alice Clark and moved to Bell Avenue in Quaker Town. This property is where Mr. Skinner ran his shoe shop and repaired 
                        some toys for Quaker Town residents on the side. The city of Denton evicted and purchased the Skinner’s property on July 1922 for only $1,000.00. 
                        This forced the couple and their children to move to 418 E. Prairie across the tracks from Alliance Miling. The street that runs along their property 
                        has been named Joe Skinner.
