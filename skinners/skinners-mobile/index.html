Originally married to Emily Weeks in 1878, and having several children with her, Joseph Skinner was a long-time resident of Denton. Mrs. Weeks passed in June 1913. On Christmas Day of that same year, Joeseph married Mrs. Alice Clark and moved to Bell Avenue in Quaker Town. This property is where Mr. Skinner ran his shoe shop and repaired some toys for Quaker Town residents on the side. 
The city of Denton evicted and purchased the Skinner’s property on July 1922 for only $1,000.00. This forced the couple and their children to move to 418 E. Prairie across the tracks from Alliance Miling. The street that runs along their property has been named Joe Skinner. </span><div class="v70_3"><div class="v2_154"></div><span class="v2_155">Image Caption: Joe and Alice Skinner photographed on Bell Avenue, Image Courtesy Denton County Office of Culture and History. </span></div><span class="v2_156">MR.
